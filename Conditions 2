I find if I put a number between 1 to 10 it always falls to the else statement.

if number in range(1, 5):
    print "You entered a number in the range of 1 to 6"
elif number in range(6, 10):
    print "You entered a number in the range of 6 to 11"
else:
    print "Your number wasn't in the correct range"
