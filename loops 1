1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
for rock in range(1500,2700):
  if rock%7==0 and rock%5==0:
    print ("jazz",rock)

2. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
word =("Reverse the words")
for char in range(len(word)):
  print(word[char])

3. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
x,y=1,2
while y<50:
    print(y)
      x,y = y,x+y

4.Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
for x in range(6):
  if (x == 3 or x==6):
     break
     print(x,end=' ')
5. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
